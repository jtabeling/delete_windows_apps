# Product Context: WindowsApps Manager

## Problem Statement
Windows 10/11 stores Microsoft Store applications in the `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps` folder, which can consume significant disk space over time. Users have limited built-in options to:
- View detailed information about installed apps
- Safely remove unwanted applications and their dependencies
- Free up disk space comprehensively
- Manage app-related registry entries and user data

## Target Users
- Power users who need granular control over installed applications
- System administrators managing disk space
- Users with limited storage who need to optimize space usage
- Technical users comfortable with administrative operations

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Workflow
1. **Launch** → Application starts with administrator privileges
2. **Scan** → Automatically enumerate WindowsApps folder contents
3. **Browse** → View detailed information about each installed app
4. **Select** → Choose apps for deletion with comprehensive information
5. **Backup** → Automatic backup creation before deletion
6. **Delete** → Safe removal with progress tracking
7. **Verify** → Confirmation of successful cleanup

### Safety First Approach
- Multiple confirmation layers prevent accidental deletions
- Automatic backups enable recovery from mistakes
- Protected app whitelist prevents system damage
- Clear warnings for critical system applications

### Information Transparency
Users should see exactly what they're managing:
- Real disk space usage per application
- Installation dates and versions
- Publisher information and app relationships
- Impact assessment before deletion

### Efficient Operations
- Batch selection and deletion capabilities
- Progress indicators for long-running operations
- Search and filter for quick app location
- Sorting by size, date, name for prioritization

## Success Metrics
- User can safely free up significant disk space
- Zero system stability issues from app removal
- Intuitive interface requires minimal learning
- Comprehensive cleanup leaves no orphaned files
- Recovery options provide confidence in operations
